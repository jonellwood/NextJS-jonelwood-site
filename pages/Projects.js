            <h2>License Fee Calculation App </h2>
            <p>I initially did this project in Python and then realized the challenges of implementing it on a Wordpress site. Rewriting in in Javascript was quite a learning experience that started me on a fun journey of learning.</p>

            <h2>Lobby Display</h2>
            <p>Simple Solution to avoid walking up and down stairs</p>
            <p>After paying nearing $120/month for a service to create a lobby display I was motivated to write my own after realizing it is all just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I saved money, provided a better bespoke product, and it can be deployed programmatically to keep me from walking down the stairs to update each time. </p>
